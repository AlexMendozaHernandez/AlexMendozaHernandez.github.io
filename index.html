		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website! I'm a Class of 2026 freshman at the University of North Florida, where I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. My journey in STEM education began in the summer of 2021 when I started teaching robotics and other STEM-based curricula at Indian River State College.

As an enthusiastic educator, I find great joy in inspiring students and fostering their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Through teaching, I not only share my knowledge and skills but also continue to learn and grow alongside my students.</p>

<p>Beyond my passion for robotics and STEM, I have developed a political ambition that has driven me to become actively involved in my university's Student Government. I started as a senator and currently hold the position of Senate President Pro-Tempore. This role allows me to advocate for student voices, ensure transparency in decision-making processes, and promote the values of representation and inclusivity on campus.</p>

    <p>Recognizing the significance of effective governance, I am committed to creating an environment where every student feels heard and empowered. I believe that open communication, collaboration, and accountability are crucial in building a thriving and supportive university community.

Alongside my engagement in Student Government, I remain dedicated to my academic pursuits in mechanical engineering. I am fascinated by the intricacies of the field and the endless possibilities it offers in shaping the future through innovation and technological advancements.

Through this website, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and resources on robotics, STEM education, and student governance.</p>

<p>Here, you'll find valuable information about teaching robotics, updates on my involvement in Student Government, and discussions on the intersection of engineering and politics.
  
Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the world of robotics, STEM education, and student advocacy. Together, we can work towards a future that prioritizes inclusivity, transparency, and positive change. 

Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions, collaboration opportunities, or ideas for making a difference in our university community. Let's make an impact together!</p>
